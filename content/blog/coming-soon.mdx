# Coming Soon

I'm setting up this blog to share thoughts on:

- **Building with AI** — Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and the new wave of AI-native development
- **EdTech** — What I'm learning building apps for kids at Alpha School
- **Open Source** — Updates on scribble-ui, context-layer, and other projects
- **Engineering** — TanStack, Swift, React, and the tools I use daily

Check back soon, or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mitchforest) for updates.

// The traditional first post
console.log("Hello, world!")
```
