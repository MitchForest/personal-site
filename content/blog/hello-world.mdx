# Hello World

This is the first post on my new terminal-style website. Built with:

- **TanStack Start** for React + routing
- **Shiki** for syntax highlighting
- **Velite** for MDX content
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## Why Terminal Style?

I spend most of my day in neovim and the terminal. This aesthetic feels like home.

```typescript
// The core of any good project
export function main() {
  console.log("Hello, world!")
}
```

More posts coming soon.
